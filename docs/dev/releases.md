# Staging Releases

Don't wait for maintainers to cut a release! You can stage a release at any time
using GitHub. Just open a PR against the release branch from master. If merged,
a new release will automatically be cut.

Please be sure to bump the version and update CHANGELOG.md and include your
changelog text in the PR body.
